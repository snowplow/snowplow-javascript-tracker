## EmitterConfigurationBase.dontRetryStatusCodes property

List of HTTP response status codes for which events sent to Collector should not be retried in future request. Only non-success status codes are considered (greater or equal to 300). The don't retry codes are only considered for GET and POST requests. By default, the tracker retries on all non-success status codes except for 400, 401, 403, 410, and 422 (these don't retry codes will remain even if you set your own `dontRetryStatusCodes` but can be changed using the `retryStatusCodes`<!-- -->).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
dontRetryStatusCodes?: number[];
```
