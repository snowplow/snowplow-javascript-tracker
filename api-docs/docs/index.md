# JavaScript trackers
The Snowplow JavaScript trackers support being used in a number of environments.

## Web tracking
We have two flavours of web tracker: JavaScript and Browser.

- JavaScript tracker (v2, v3, and v4) for loading via tags, by adding code snippets to your website or Tag Manager solution.
- Browser tracker (v3 and v4) for installation into web apps via npm. Popular when natively integrating tracking into React, Angular and Vue applications.

From v3 onwards, the JavaScript tracker is implemented as a wrapper around the Browser tracker.

Find high-level documentation for both in the [Web trackers](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/web-trackers/) section.

## Server-side tracking
Track events in server-side Node.js environments using the Node.js tracker (v3 and v4). Used via npm.

## App tracking
Track events in React Native environments including mobile applications with the React Native tracker.
