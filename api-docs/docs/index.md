# JavaScript Trackers
The Snowplow JavaScript Trackers support being used in a number of environments. There are three versions of the tracker.

## Web tracking
We have two flavours of web tracker: JavaScript and Browser.

- JavaScript Tracker (v2 and v3) for loading via tags, by adding code snippets to your website or Tag Manager solution.
- Browser Tracker (v3) for installation into web apps via npm. Popular when natively integrating tracking into React, Angular and Vue applications.

Find the documentation for both in the [Web trackers](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/) section.


## Server-side tracking
Track events in server-side Node.js environments using the Node.js Tracker (v3). Used via npm.
